## Executive Summary

**What is NormalDB?**
NormalDB is a full-stack Database Management System project that implements automated database normalization (UNF → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF) with an interactive, scroll-driven educational interface. It combines theoretical DBMS concepts (functional dependencies, candidate key detection, schema decomposition) with practical implementation using PostgreSQL, demonstrating both the "what" and "how" of normalization.

## Part 1: Project Justification (Why This is a DBMS Project)

### Opening Statement (30 seconds)

"NormalDB is fundamentally a DBMS project because it implements three core database system components: **schema design automation**, **dependency analysis using relational theory**, and **dynamic schema evolution with data migration**. While it has a visualization layer for educational purposes, the heart of the system is a normalization engine that operates directly on PostgreSQL schemas—creating, transforming, and managing database structures based on functional dependency analysis."

### The Three Pillars (Detailed Defense)

#### 1. Schema Design & Relational Theory Implementation

**What we built:**
- Automated detection of functional dependencies from data using value-pattern heuristics
- Candidate key discovery via attribute closure computation (Armstrong's axioms)
- Normal form validation (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) based on formal definitions
- Schema decomposition algorithms that preserve lossless joins

**Why this is DBMS:**
This directly implements Codd's normalization theory—the foundation of relational database design. We're not just teaching normalization; we're building a tool that automates what database designers do manually. The system understands relational algebra concepts like:
- Functional dependencies: X → Y
- Candidate keys: minimal superkeys via closure
- Decomposition: splitting R into R1, R2 while preserving dependencies

**Evidence:**
- [Show code] `FunctionalDependency.js` - implements FD detection algorithm
- [Show code] `CandidateKeyFinder.js` - closure computation, superkey minimality tests
- [Show output] Console showing detected FDs and candidate keys for sample data

#### 2. Dynamic Schema Evolution & Data Migration

**What we built:**
- Automatic SQL DDL generation (CREATE TABLE statements with constraints)
- Data migration scripts that transform existing data from UNF → 3NF
- Multi-version schema storage: stores original, 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF schemas simultaneously
- Referential integrity enforcement via foreign key constraint generation

**Why this is DBMS:**
Schema evolution is a critical database administration task. Our system doesn't just suggest normalization—it **executes it on a real PostgreSQL database**. When you click "Apply to DB," it:
1. Creates new normalized tables with proper PRIMARY KEY constraints
2. Migrates data using INSERT INTO ... SELECT statements
3. Establishes FOREIGN KEY relationships
4. Maintains data integrity throughout the transformation

This is database engineering, not just visualization.

**Evidence:**
- [Show code] `SQLGenerator.js` - produces parameterized, injection-safe SQL
- [Show database] pgAdmin showing before/after schemas in PostgreSQL
- [Show migration log] Transformation steps with row counts and FK relationships

#### 3. Metadata Management & Query Optimization Foundations

**What we built:**
- Internal metadata schema tracking:
  - `datasets` table: stores uploaded CSV metadata
  - `transformations` table: records each normalization step
  - `normalized_schemas` table: stores resulting table definitions
  - `dependency_catalog` table: maintains FD inventory
- Foundation for query optimization: identifying join paths via FK relationships

**Why this is DBMS:**
Modern DBMS rely on system catalogs (like PostgreSQL's `pg_catalog`) to manage metadata. We implement a similar pattern—our system doesn't just normalize data; it maintains a complete audit trail of schema transformations. This metadata enables:
- Version control for schemas
- Rollback capabilities
- Query path analysis (which tables to join, in what order)

**Evidence:**
- [Show schema] ER diagram of our internal metadata schema
- [Show query] SELECT from `transformations` showing normalization history
- [Show code] `models/Transformation.js` - ORM for transformation tracking

## Part 2: Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Where is the database? This looks like a visualization project."

**Answer:**
The database is PostgreSQL, running in the Docker container `normaldb-postgres`. The frontend visualization is intentionally educational—it teaches users what's happening—but every normalization operation executes real SQL on PostgreSQL.

**Demonstration:**
1. Open Docker logs: `docker logs normaldb-postgres`
2. Show CREATE TABLE statements being executed
3. Run `psql` query: `\\dt` to list tables created by normalization
4. Query data: `SELECT * FROM network;` showing migrated TV channel data

The visualization makes the DBMS concepts understandable, but the substance is the database operations.

### Q2: "How do you detect functional dependencies and candidate keys?"

**Answer:**
We use a combination of algorithms:

**FD Detection (O(n²·m) complexity):**
1. For each attribute pair (X, Y), group rows by X values
2. Check if each X-value maps to exactly one Y-value
3. Calculate confidence: (1 - violations/total_pairs)
4. Accept FD if confidence ≥ 98%

**Limitations acknowledged:**
- Small datasets may show false positives (coincidental uniqueness)
- Cannot detect dependencies with exceptions
- NULL handling is simplified

**Candidate Key Finding (O(2^m) worst case, pruned):**
1. Identify "must-include" attributes (never on RHS of any FD)
2. Use closure computation to test superkey property
3. Check minimality by attempting to remove each attribute
4. Prune search space with heuristics (limit to size ≤4)

**Code reference:** [Show] `computeClosure()` function implementing iterative fixed-point algorithm.

### Q3: "How is this more than just a visualization tool?"

**Answer:**
Three concrete differences:

1. **It modifies database state:**
   - Creates tables, inserts data, establishes constraints
   - Visualization tools only read and display data
   
2. **It implements DBMS algorithms:**
   - Closure computation (Armstrong's axioms)
   - Lossless decomposition
   - Dependency preservation checking
   
3. **It solves a real database problem:**
   - Denormalized legacy systems exist everywhere
   - NormalDB automates the painful task of schema refactoring
   - Production use case: analyzing and cleaning up messy operational databases

**Analogy:**
If a database query optimizer is considered core DBMS (and it is), then a normalization engine should be too. Both analyze data properties and restructure operations for efficiency and correctness.

### Q4: "What are the algorithmic limitations?"

**Answer (honest and technical):**

| Algorithm | Limitation | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| FD Detection | False positives on small data (<100 rows) | Require confidence threshold ≥98%, warn users |
| Candidate Key Finding | Exponential complexity (2^m) | Prune to combinations ≤4 attributes, use heuristics |
| Closure Computation | O(k·f) per iteration | Caching, early termination when closure stabilizes |
| 3NF Decomposition | May not minimize number of tables | We optimize for understandability over table count |

**Research-grade limitations:**
- We don't handle approximate FDs (CORDS algorithm needed)
- Multi-valued dependencies (4NF/5NF) not yet supported
- Doesn't optimize for query workload patterns

But for educational and moderate-scale use, the algorithms are sound.

### Q5: "Why not just use SQL normalization commands?"

**Answer:**
SQL doesn't have built-in normalization commands! That's exactly the problem we solve.

Standard SQL can:
- Define schemas (CREATE TABLE)
- Enforce constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY)

Standard SQL **cannot:**
- Auto-detect functional dependencies from data
- Suggest normalized schemas
- Generate decomposition strategies

That's why DBAs do this manually—or use tools like NormalDB. Our system bridges the gap between theory (normalization rules in textbooks) and practice (actual schema refactoring).

### Q6: "Can this handle production-scale databases?"

**Answer (honest assessment):**

**Current capabilities:**
- ✅ Datasets up to 100K rows
- ✅ Schemas with ≤20 attributes
- ✅ Complexity manageable for OLTP schemas

**Limitations for large-scale:**
- ❌ FD detection is O(n²), so 10M+ rows would be slow
- ❌ No distributed processing
- ❌ No incremental FD updates

**Production path forward:**
1. Use sampling for large datasets (random 10K rows for FD detection)
2. Implement approximate FD algorithms (FastFD, HyFD)
3. Add caching and materialized views
4. Integrate with existing ETL pipelines

For educational use and medium databases (<1M rows), it's production-ready.

## Part 3: Key Talking Points (Memorize These)

### The "Why DBMS" Elevator Pitch

"NormalDB implements the normalization subsystem that every DBMS needs but few expose as a user-facing feature. Just like query optimization happens inside PostgreSQL, normalization typically happens during database design. We've made that process automated, auditable, and visual. The PostgreSQL integration proves it's not a simulation—it's real database engineering."

### The "Technical Depth" Statement

"We implement three graduate-level algorithms: attribute closure computation for key finding, FD discovery using agree-set analysis, and lossless decomposition with dependency preservation. Each has published complexity analysis, and we've documented our heuristics for managing exponential blowup. This is algorithmically rigorous work, grounded in Codd's 1971 normalization theory and later research from Bernstein, Beeri, and others."

### The "Practical Value" Argument

"Legacy databases are often denormalized disasters—duplicate data, update anomalies, inconsistent states. NormalDB automates schema refactoring, which is currently a manual, error-prone process. Companies could use this to analyze their operational schemas, identify normalization opportunities, and generate migration scripts. It's both educational and practical."

## Part 5: Closing Statement (30 seconds)

"NormalDB proves that database theory isn't just abstract—it's implementable and useful. We built a system that any DBA could use to analyze and improve real schemas. It combines the rigor of relational theory with the practicality of SQL schema evolution. The interactive visualization makes it approachable for students, but underneath, it's a serious database engineering tool. Thank you."
